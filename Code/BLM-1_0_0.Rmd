**What should be in our R markdown**

R Code
Produce a R markdown of your analyses as a nb.html (not from knitr). 
Your code must contain title, authors, project abstract (problem statement, description, and conclusions), appropriate headings (#), detailed explanations of what each chunk does, and code chunks with comments.
Do not leave unused code in the file.
