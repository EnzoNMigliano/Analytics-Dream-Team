## Why, Where, when, and How?

**Why?**

There is plenty of evidence of the mistreatment some minorities receive in the American society. So much so that here are some facts about such reality:

 - Jurors are more likely to give the death penalty in cases in which Afrincan American Defendents are accused of killing [1].
 
 - Unarmed African Americans are 3.5 more likely to be shot by police than unarmed Caucasian [2].
 
 - Up to March of 2017, 47% of all exonerations of wrongfully convicted people were African Americans while making up only 13% of the United States Population [3].
 
 - African Americans are 6 times more likely than Caucasians to victim of a homicide (African Americans 19.6 homicides per 100,000, Caucasians 3.3 homicides per 100,000) [4].
