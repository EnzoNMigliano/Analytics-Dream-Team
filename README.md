## Why, Where, when, and How?
**Why?**

There is plenty of evidence of the mistreatment some minorities receive in the American society. So much so that here are some facts about such reality:

 - Jurors are more likely to give the death penalty in cases in which Afrincan American Defendents are accused of killing [1].
 
 - Unarmed African Americans are 3.5 more likely to be shot by police than unarmed Caucasian [2].
 
 - Up to March of 2017, 47% of all exonerations of wrongfully convicted people were African Americans while making up only 13% of the United States Population [3].
 
 - African Americans are 6 times more likely than Caucasians to victim of a homicide (African Americans 19.6 homicides per 100,000, Caucasians 3.3 homicides per 100,000) [4].
 <br />
 
**Where?**

Our team strived to collect data from different locations to compare and contrast what is happening in different sprectruns such as: 

 - City (e.g., New York City and the stop and frisk police implications)
 
 - Count (e.g., Comparing and contrasting close by counts)  
 
 - State (e.g., State comparison of police brutality indicators)
 
 - United States (e.g., National overview of the social injustice problem)
 <br />
 
**When?**

2020 was a espressive year for the Black Lives Matter movement with protests for racial justice happening all around the globe.The data of the social injustice, however, is not only expressive in the present time. In fact, the data on social injustice has been expressive for many years. Therefore, our team collected data from different periods of time to better understand the development of the social injustice up to today's society.

<br />

**How?**

Our team collected more than 2gb worth of data from different reliable sources such as:
 
 - Governmental data (e.g., data.gov).
 
 - News papers (e.g., Whashington Post).
 
 - Reliable private institutions (e.g., Google, Twitter).
 
 The data was utilized for our different staticals analisys ranging from descriptive to predictive analytics, as well as good visualizations of the problems.
